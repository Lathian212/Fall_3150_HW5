Answer: Even though the parent and child are in different packages the child has access to PROTECTED 
methods and variables in this case an int in the parent class.

Program Output:
Protected variable in Parent invocation through Child  child.protectParent()= 888

There is a great table in Liang and explanation:

" Often it is desirable to allow subclasses to access data fields or methods defined in the
superclass, but not to allow nonsubclasses to access these data fields and methods. To accomplish
this, you can use the protected keyword. This way you can access protected data
fields or methods in a superclass from its subclasses. ...
Use the protected modifier to enable the members of the class to
be accessed by the subclasses in any package or classes in the same package."
