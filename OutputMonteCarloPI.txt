Starting Monte Carlo estimate of PI with an R of: 10000 and 4 billion points.
M The total number of points falling in the circle = 3141369736
The total number of points falling just in the square = 858630264
N, the total number of points = 4000000000
A monte carlo estimate of PI = (M*4)/N = 3.141369736
Actual value of PI= 3.141592653589793
